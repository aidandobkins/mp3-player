# mp3 player

This is a project done for CS2308 aka CS Fundamentals 2, with a big focus on C++ advanced development.

This program is an MP3 player simulator, utilizing stacks and linked lists to handle song queues, and the playlist information.
This project was completed in my first year of university, and should be an indication of my progress throughout my career and schooling.
